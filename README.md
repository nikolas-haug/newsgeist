# newsgeist

NewsGeist is a news aggregator designed to return headlines to its users from a variety of news outlets spanning the ideological spectrum. This gives users broad insight into how any given topic is being reported. Users can also contribute to the NewsGeist database by rating and categorizing the articles that they read on the site.

## Motivation

We want to allow the user to find news articles from a wide variety of sources. Pairing the articles retrieved from [NewsApi.org] with the randomized images from the [Giphy Api], we want to further distort the user's expectations when searching the web for the world's news. The option to rate and categorize the articles viewed provides a means to filter news through user discretion.
